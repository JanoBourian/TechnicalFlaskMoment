# TechnicalFlaskMoment
A little approach and brief with Flask and its Features from a REST API perspective.

## First steps

Always, before all, we need to create a virtual environment and the most easy way to do it is with venv (included in python), after that we need to activate the virtual environment and the next step is to have a requeriments.txt file

```bash
python -m venv flask
flask\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install black
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
